My custom multithreaded example of finding a random sorted array vs. single thread


# Multithreads
An important example of Multithreaded vs. Single threaded app
Make sure to use a reasonable amount of threads, not more than the ACTUAL threads your CPU got.
It is possible, but will bottleneck it immediately (YMMV).

i.e in my case I had a 8C/16T i9 CPU so I created 16 threads (*But could use any number>1 and number<=16)

With this one little program you can understand basically all the fundamentals of Threads, Concurrency, (Kind of) Shared Resource, Volatile memory etc.

# This program was created as a simple question for my Year 2 students as a cool example. If anyone finds it - enjoy :)
